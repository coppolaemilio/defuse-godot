# Defuse! ðŸ’£

Hello operator:

Are you tired of working without any distraction? Do you miss having random interruptions from your family or your coworkers?

Wait no more!

With this add on you will have to be defusing bombs while working on Godot. After a random amount of time a bomb will show up on your screen and you have to click to defuse it.

## How to install

Download the project and add the `addons/defuse` to your Godot project and enable it on your plugin settings.





I'm sorry.
